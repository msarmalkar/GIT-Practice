GIT-Practice

1. Always work on a separate branch which is created from your public working branch
2. Branch name should be meaningful :   
    ISSUE_TYPE/GIT_USERNAME/CURRENT_DATE/TP-#-SHORT-DESCRIPTION  
    feature : feature/username/date/ticket#-brief_desc  
    bugfix : bugfix/username/date/ticket#-brief_desc
3. NEVER rebase public branch onto your feature branch
4. Always git pull main branch before you create a new branch from it or ready for PR
5. NEVER use reset for public commits
6. Use .gitignore wisely to ignore files from repo
